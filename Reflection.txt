Effect of P,I,D Gains:

Having only Proprtional-gain in place introduced a spring-like effect, pulling in the car to the equilibrium
(0-error) position but acting like a pure spring, it brought along with it, oscillations !! 
With low Kp, car didn't retract back in time while with high Kp, it exhibited high overshoots and sustained
oscillation.
D-gain introduced the much needed damping here, killing the excessive oscillations. Though too high a D-gain
can also lead to high frequency oscillations, making controller too sensitive to error changes.
Integral gain had no effect on the transient response of the steering command. It does helps in getting the 
steady state error to zero, but there is always a chance of integral wind up problem, when this term gets
too big, as a result of either a large I-gain or a sustained error or both. This can be mitigated by either 
limiting or resetting the I-term appropriately.

The final hyper-parameters were chosen using the auto-tuning twiddle algorithm. The algorithm was initialized
with ballpark P and D gains with 0 I-gain (and 0 - deltaI gain) in the beginning. The resulting optimized gains
were again fed back to twiddle, this time for fine tuning. In this second iteration, the tuning interval was
increased, and also, this time, the deltaI was set to a non-zero value, enabling the auto-tuning of integral 
gain as well in this iteration. It is also observed that the set of optimum gains change with car speed. As 
we go to higher throttle values, we need tighter, agressive gains. This calls for tuning at multiple throttle
values and then using a look-up table for interpolating and getting appropriate PID gains for a given throttle.
